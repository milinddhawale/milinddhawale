# 👋 Hi, I'm Milind Dhawale  

💡 **AI/ML Engineer | LLM Enthusiast | Business-Minded Technologist**  

I’m transitioning from a strong **marketing + business strategy** background into the world of **AI/ML engineering**, blending technical expertise with product-thinking.  
Currently, I’m building **Veda AI** — a modular multi-agent system of **domain-specific LLMs** (using QLoRA, PEFT, FAISS, RAG) that enable businesses to adopt AI in a scalable and cost-efficient way.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On  
- **Veda AI** → Modular domain-specific LLM system (QLoRA, PEFT, FAISS, RAG)  
- **AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot** → Automating support with contextual LLMs  
- **Supply Chain Optimization Tool** → AI-driven demand forecasting & logistics planning  
- **Healthcare Diagnostics Assistant (Imaging focus)** → Deep learning for healthcare insights  
- **Flask-based AI Tools Website** → A collection of mini AI tools (Notepad, QR Generator, File Converter, Chatbot, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
**Languages & Frameworks**  
- Python, Flask, FastAPI, Django  
- React.js (beginner level, exploring for full-stack AI apps)  

**AI/ML & Data Science**  
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face  
- QLoRA, PEFT, FAISS, RAG  
- Time Series Forecasting (LSTM, ARIMA)  
- NLP (Sentiment Analysis, Text Classification, Recommenders)  
- Audio & Image Processing (CNNs, Audio Classification)  

**Cloud & MLOps**  
- AWS (SageMaker, Lambda, S3, Glue, Redshift, CloudWatch)  
- Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines  
- Model Deployment, Monitoring, and Optimization  

**Other Tools**  
- Tableau, SQL, Git/GitHub

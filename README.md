# 👋 Hi, I'm Milind Dhawale  

💡 **AI/ML Engineer | LLM Enthusiast | Business-Minded Technologist**  

I’m transitioning from a strong **marketing + business strategy** background into the world of **AI/ML engineering**, blending technical expertise with product thinking.  
Currently, I’m building **Veda AI** — a modular multi-agent system of **domain-specific LLMs** (using QLoRA, PEFT, FAISS, RAG) that enable businesses to adopt AI in a scalable and cost-efficient way.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On  
- **Veda AI** → Modular domain-specific LLM system (QLoRA, PEFT, FAISS, RAG)  
- **Sales Forecasting for Retail** → Time-series forecasting using LSTM/ARIMA  
- **Generative AI Exploration** → Fine-tuning experiments and adapter training
